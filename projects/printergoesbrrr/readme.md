# $BRRRN

$BRRRN is a meme-native, deflationary protest token.  
It wasn't designed to pump — it was designed to disappear.  
Not a solution. A response.

## 🔥 Overview

- Fixed supply: 35 trillion plus 1 token
- 10T burned at launch  
- LP burned  
- Mint authority disabled or multisig-controlled  
- Lives on Solana  
- Marches toward one remaining token — maybe (its up to you)
