# $BRRR Manifesto

$BRRR is not an investment. It is a protest.

A fixed-supply meme token launched in response to the growing absurdity of federal debt and fiat monetary policy.

In 2024, U.S. federal debt crossed $35 trillion.  
By 2035, the Congressional Budget Office projects it will exceed $55 trillion.

$BRRR mirrors that trajectory — then burns it.

---

Each $BRRR burn is a symbolic rejection of unchecked expansion:  
debt ceilings, stimulus cycles, and economic theater.

The more absurd the system, the more we burn.
