# BRRR: When the Printer Goes BRRR... We Burn

## Overview

**$BRRR** is a meme token launched on Solana with a singular purpose:  
To reflect the absurdity of modern monetary policy by **burning tokens** in response to increases in federal debt and the devaluation of the dollar.

- U.S. federal debt is over **$35 trillion**, and forecast to exceed **$55 trillion by 2035**
- Since 2020, debt has already increased by **$10 trillion**
- The U.S. now runs an **annual deficit of $1.9 trillion**

Inspired by economic satire and internet culture, BRRR is **not an investment**, financial product, or promise of profit. It is a **deflationary, fair-launch meme token** with:

- No presale  
- No team rewards  
- No unlocks  

---

## Purpose

BRRR exists to make a mockery of fiat inflation and unchecked debt expansion.

- At launch, **10T BRRR were burned** to match post-2020 debt growth  
- As debt continues to rise, additional reserves are set to be burned
- The protocol matches every **community burn 1:1**  
- Final burn target: only **1 token will remain**

> They borrow from tomorrow.  
> We burn today.

## Allocation Logic

- **35T BRRR** matches **$35T debt**
- **10T burned at launch** to match 2020–2024 federal debt increase
- **158B/month** burned going forward (based on $1.9T annual overspend)

Additional burns triggered by:
- Debt ceiling increases  
- CBO debt forecast revisions  
- Stimulus packages or fiscal gimmicks
- Other fiscal and monetary absurdity

Community burns are encouraged — if it smells like fiat madness, burn it.

- Meme culture alignment  
- Easy integrations with Jupiter, Raydium, Phantom

## 🪞 Meme Utility

BRRR isn’t useful in the traditional sense.

No yield. No staking. No promise of utility.  
Its utility is **cultural** — it’s a meme, a protest, and an on-chain joke.

> And the more absurd things get, the more we burn.

---

## 🔥 Burn Strategy

**Timing**
- Monthly burns aligned with deficit cycle or key announcements
- Event-based burns on debt forecasts, policy moves, or “print moments”

**Pacing**
- 22.5T burn reserve designed to last 1–2 years  
- 1.1T community match pool for 1:1 matched airdrop burns  
- Final design leaves **1 BRRR** as a permanent meme monument

---

## 💀 The Final Token

When the last reserve is burned, one BRRR will remain.  
The final survivor of a meme-fueled war on fiscal irresponsibility.  
A timestamped tombstone of what they took from the future.

Will you be the one to hold it?  
Will you have the meme, the selflessness, the 🔥balls🔥 to burn it?

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

BRRR is not a security.  
It was not sold or promoted with expectation of profit.  
There is no roadmap, no company, and no central control.
BRRR is satire, commentary, and protest — expressed through burn.

If you buy BRRR, you're buying a joke.  
And jokes burn.
