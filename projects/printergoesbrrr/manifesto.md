📣 Manifesto
BRRR: When the Printer Goes BRRR… We Burn
They print. We burn.
A trillion dollars used to mean something.
Now it’s just Tuesday.

So we created $BRRR: a token that embraces monetary absurdity by doing what no central bank dares — setting itself on fire.

They create value with a keystroke.
We destroy it with a burn.
They inflate. We incinerate.
They pretend it's working.
We pretend burning fixes it.

🧨 What is $BRRR?
A meme token on Solana with one purpose:
to burn tokens every time fiat goes feral.

We don’t offer utility.
We offer ritualized destruction.

Launched with no presale, no unlocks, no team, and no plan.
Just 35 trillion BRRR — one for every U.S. dollar of federal debt.
The burn has already begun.

🔥 The Burn Protocol
If they print it, we burn it. If you burn it, we match it.

Monthly Burns
BRRR is burned each month based on fiscal and monetary absurdity

The more absurd, the more fire.

Debt ceiling raised? Stimulus package announced? Deficit increases?

🔥 You know what happens

Community Burns
You burn. The protocol burns 1:1 from the match pool

This is the only path to reach 1 final token remaining


💀 The Final Token
Eventually, just one BRRR will remain.
One token to symbolise the absurdity.

Do you hold it?
Do you burn it?
What happens next?


🪙 Tokenomics
Allocation	Amount	Purpose
Total Supply	35T	Mirrors $35T U.S. federal debt
Initial Burn	10T	Matches debt increase since 2020
Burn Reserve	21.8T	For monthly & event-based burns
Liquidity (burned)	1T	Permanent LP
Airdrop	1T + 1 token	Community distribution + final BRRR
Community Match Pool	1T	Matches user burns 1:1 — this is the path to 1 remaining token

🔑 Core Mechanics
No presale

No VC

No unlocks

No team tokens

0% tax

Minting disabled

Contract renounced

LP burned

Multisig only executes protocol burns

No treasury. No control. No recovery.

🌐 Why Solana?
Gas costs so low, you’ll burn without thinking

Lightning-fast for degenerate rituals

Meme-aligned ecosystem

Plug-and-play with Jupiter, Raydium, Phantom

Also, launching this on Ethereum would’ve doubled the U.S. deficit.

🪞 Use Case
None.
There is no point. That is the point.

No yield. No staking. No value accrual.
$BRRR exists purely to vanish on-chain — faster than your purchasing power.

It’s fiscal fire as performance art.

🧱 Ethos
No governance

No DAO

No treasury proposals

No votes to ignore

Just burns, memes, and the shared delusion that this means something.

You don’t use $BRRR.
You sacrifice it.

⚠️ Disclaimers
$BRRR is not a security

It was never sold

It does nothing

It is not for profit

This is satire, not finance

If you’re here for utility, we wish you luck

✊ Final Words
They debase the dollar.
We debase ourselves.

They print like it’s working.
We burn like it is.

Print is the answer. Burn is the response.
$BRRR
