# $BRRRN Tokenomics

**Total Supply:** 35,000,000,000,001 BRRRN (35T + 1)

$BRRRN mirrors the absurdity it mocks.

The U.S. federal debt passed $35 trillion in 2024 and continues to rise.  
So we matched it — and began to burn it.

There’s no promise here. No fix.  
Just a token that disappears in protest.

## 🔥 Burn Protocol

- **Initial Burn:** 10T — erased at launch to match 2020–2024 debt growth  
- **Monthly Burn:** ~158B — tied to the $1.9T annual deficit, divided monthly  
- **Event Burns:** Triggered by fiscal theatre:
  - New deficits  
  - Debt ceiling lifts  
  - Emergency stimulus  
  - CBO revisions  
  - Fed speeches that dare to pretend

> No tax. No treasury. No recovery.  
> Minting disabled. Contract renounced.

## 📉 Burn Philosophy

Burns are permanent.  
Tracked on-chain.  
Executed without ceremony — just a match and a wallet.

Voluntary community burns are matched 1:1 from the pool.  
Protocol burns happen monthly — or whenever reality demands it.

Everything is designed to disappear.

## 🧨 The Endgame

No token is held back.  
No vault. No script.

All 10T + 1 were released.  
And if just one remains, it won't be because we planned it.  
It’ll be because **the community made it happen**.

> Will you hold it?  
> Or will you burn the last thing left?

Some say there are forces resisting the system —  
Fighting not to reform it, but to expose it.
