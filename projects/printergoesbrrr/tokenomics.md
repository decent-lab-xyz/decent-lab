# $BRRR Tokenomics

Total Supply: **35,000,000,000,000** BRRR (35T)

This supply mirrors the U.S. federal debt, which crossed $35 trillion in 2024 and is projected to exceed $55 trillion by 2035.  
Since 2020, debt has already increased by over $10 trillion — and BRRR reflects that reality by burning supply in response.

## 🔥 Launch & Burn Logic

- **Initial Burn**: 10T BRRR burned at launch  
  → Matches the debt added since 2020  
- **Monthly Burn**: ~158B BRRR  
  → Matches the $1.9T annual U.S. deficit (divided by 12)  
- **Event Burns**: Bonus burns triggered by:
  - CBO upward revisions
  - New stimulus spending
  - Debt ceiling lifts
  - Fed speeches or clownery

| 🌊 LP Burn          | 1T       | Seeded and burned — no liquidity control remains   |
| 🎯 Airdrop + 1      | 1T + 1   | Distributed to meme-aligned holders                |
| 🧳 Treasury Reserve | 0.1T     | For ETH/Base/CEX future use                        |

## 📉 Burn Design Philosophy

- All burns are on-chain and traceable
- Burns are multisig-executed — no voting, no delays
- Community burns are matched 1-for-1 from the match pool

## 🧨 The Endgame

Once all matching is complete, **only 1 BRRR** will remain.  
A lone meme. A digital protest artifact. A timestamped rejection of debt.

> Will you hold it?  
> Or will you burn it?
