# Decent Lab Manifesto

**Decent Lab** is a meme-native protocol studio encoding economic satire into blockchain permanence.

We believe:

- Supply destruction > empty hype  
- Proof > promises  
- Tokens should vanish in protest, not pump in silence

## Core Principles

- Irony doesn’t preclude trust — both can coexist  
- Community trust is built, not claimed  
- No team tokens. No hidden allocations.  
- All burn signatures traceable to `decentlab.eth`

**Trust isn’t told. It’s timestamped.**
