# Decent Lab Manifesto

**Decent Lab** is a meme-native protocol studio encoding economic satire into blockchain permanence.

We believe:

- Supply destruction > empty hype  
- Proof > promises  
- Tokens should vanish in protest

## Core Principles

- Irony doesn’t preclude trust — both can coexist  
- Community trust is built, not claimed  
- No team tokens. No hidden allocations.  
- All burn signatures trace to the multisig Safe. https://safe.global/eth:0x853d73E33184CFf25d6Fc6ceb7AeF0B6E7Ab59C3

**Trust isn’t told. It’s timestamped.**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

No securities. Not advice.  
No roadmap. No promises. Just burns and memes.
