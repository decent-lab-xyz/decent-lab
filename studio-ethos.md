# Studio Ethos

Decent Lab explores the absurdities of modern capital through tokens that are transparent by design and self-destructive by nature.  The more absurd the system, the more we burn.

We operate with the following principles:

- Every token launch is publicly documented
- No launch includes hidden allocations
- Every burn is signed, logged, and linked
- Every Safe address is known
- ENS: [`decentlab.eth`](https://app.ens.domains/name/decentlab.eth)

Our mission isn’t to dominate markets — only to reflect them, with irony, fire, and receipts.

No roadmap. No promises. Just burns and memes.
