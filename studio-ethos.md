# Studio Ethos

Decent Lab explores the absurdities of modern capital through tokens that are transparent by design and self-destructive by nature.

We operate with the following principles:

- Every token launch is publicly documented
- No launch includes hidden allocations
- Every burn is signed, logged, and linked
- Every Safe address is known
- ENS: [`decentlab.eth`](https://app.ens.domains/name/decentlab.eth)

Our mission is not to dominate markets — it’s to reveal them. With irony, fire, and receipts.
