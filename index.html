🧪 Decent Lab
Lore-first. Meme-native. On-chain satire.
We don’t just build tokens —
We build characters, stories, and memetic worlds.

At Decent Lab, we turn the absurdity of modern systems into digital myth.
Each launch is a protocol performance.
Each token, a story pretending to be finance.

Our mission:
Mock the mess.
Build the fiction.
Make meaning out of meme.

🧨 First Release: $BRRRN
Print is the answer. Burn is the response.
A protest token marching toward a single survivor.
Ritualized disappearance in the face of infinite debt.
